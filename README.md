# Project One: Rock, Paper, Scissors #

I built this first with react, it works. You press the play round button and are given 3ish seconds to make your choice which is displayed on the 'battlefield' via the images. The winner is then given the point and this goes on until the player selects reset.

I think I actually learned a ton going about it this way. I was inspired to figure out how to create my own useState and useReducer functions once I understood what they do and how essential they are. I also am in the process of figuring out how to implement and parse JSX w/o react, using babel or typescript.

Using much of what you built-in Project 1, you will create a single page Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.

### Requirements ###

- The app has a starting view. The game doesn't start until a user clicks a button to start play.
- There is a hover state on the choices to let a user know to click.
- There is a click state on the choices to select a hand.
- A user can un-click and select another hand.
- A user must click a button to play their hand.
- Once the hand is played, display text letting the user know if they won, lost or it was a draw.
- Once the hand is played, prompt the user to play again.

### EXTRA CREDIT (must do all parts for the full point): ###
- The program keeps score over multiple games
- The user has a limited amount of time to select a hand. There will be some presentation to the user to let them know time is running out. In the designs, the words "Rock...Paper...Scissors...Shoot!, appears on the screen a word at a time".
- If a user doesn't make a choice, make one for them. Let them know you randomly selected on their behalf.
